For our manuscript "Genetically Regulated Expression in Late-Onset Alzheimerâ€™s Disease Implicates Risk Genes within Known and Novel Loci" (Chen et al. 2021, Translational psychiatry 11 (1), 1-12), we applied the genetically regulated expression (GReX) analysis in two large genetic consortiums for late-onset Alzheimer's disease, Alzheimer's Disease Genetics Consortium (ADGC) and International Genomics of Alzheimer's Project (IGAP).
